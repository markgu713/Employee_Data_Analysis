Convert Employee Data
Conversions are as follows:
  1) The Name column should be split into separate First Name and Last Name columns.
  2) The DOB data should be re-written into MM/DD/YYYY format.
  3) The SSN data should be re-written such that the first five numbers are hidden from view.
  4) The State data should be re-written as simple two-letter abbreviations.
